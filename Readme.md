# Introduction
This code is an implementation of the paper, which is described in:
Zhiqiang Li, Hongyu Zhang, Xiao-Yuan Jing, Wangyang Yu, Yueyue Liu. 
"Unsupervised Software Defect Prediction through Multi-view Clustering", 2024. 
It has submitted to the Journal of *IEEE Transactions on Reliability* under review.

# Project Structure
This directory contains the following files:

* algorihtms: a file folder contains the implementations of MUSDP and some baseline methods

* data: there are 28 versions of 8 projects, and each project contains 65 software metrics

* utilities: a file folder contains some utility functions

* test: a file folder contains the main functions to run the MUSDP and the baseline methods

* result: a file folder contains some detailed experimental results

* supplementary: a file folder contains some supplementary results

# Usage
Please run demo_MUSDP to obtain the prediction resutls of our approaches.

Our running environment is Python 3.10, Ubuntu 22.04 operating system.
